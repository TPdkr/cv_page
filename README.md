## CV WEBSITE

## Completed by TPdkr
This is a simple webiste where I describe in length my education, experience and projects. You can also access my cv.pdf
and transcript. This gives me an ability to have more visuals for things that cannot be described in text easily like
the apps I made, my css and html skills etc.

Currently only the desktop version is working as the contents have not yet been adapted to smaller screens.

## Features:
- reach out to me through any channel you like
- get my cv and transcript
- take a look at my portfolio!

## Technologies used:
- CSS
- HTML
- Github pages
