            <h2>About:</h2>
            <p>
                During my time studying here I advanced my technical skills by a kilometer while being
                just as active outside of the classroom. I participated in BMW causal machine learning
                 hackathon in Fall 2024. Also, I am a board member of 2 clubs on campus. Starting Fall
                 2024 I had a mentorship position in College 3 as a Peer mentor.
            </p>
            <p>
                While studying here I learned web and app development, essential programming languages
                and concepts. Moreover, my extra curricular occupations allowed me to improve my
                leadership, organizational and management skills.

                I studied in a specialized class with strong focus on IT, Mathematics and Physics.
                The diploma I received had all grades at 100%. The curriculum was challaning, but
                It laid the strong foundations for my degree.

            <p>Here I started learning such languages such as C++ and python, which helped me while
